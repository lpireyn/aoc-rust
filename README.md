# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), in Rust :crab:

## Project structure

This project contains one Cargo workspace per year (e.g., `2025`).
In each workspace, there is one Cargo crate per day (e.g., `day03`).

A crate contains:

- one or more binaries which print the solutions (e.g., `part1`)
- zero or more unit tests which check the examples provided
- one or more unit tests which check that the solutions are correct

My personal input files are not versioned.
